# Thoughts on my design that i could've made better


- Products: I could've made the products in a way shorter time, and made the code way more cleaner by using dialogs to look at the possible template products that you could "purchase". For example, now you have to go to /products, after choosing the category from VPS, Webhosting, or Cloud Storage, you have to go to /products/vps or webhosting or cloud, i could've used modals for this, but as i want for everything to look perfect, i went the hardway, to be honest it wasn't extra work, but it would've saved me the trouble. but i think it looks better the way it is right now.
